## Hi there! 👋
I'm Arizal, a Python Developer with a strong interest in AI and ML technologies. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

🌱 I am currently studying at STMIK Amikom Surakarta and pursuing a degree in computer science. My journey in programming began with Python, and I have been honing my skills and exploring new technologies ever since.

### 🔭 Overview

👨🏻‍💻 I have made a total of 114 commits on GitHub, which demonstrates my consistent engagement in coding activities. While this number alone may not accurately gauge my coding proficiency, it reflects my commitment to my projects and passion for coding.

👨🏻‍💼 I have created a total of 9 repositories, showcasing my proactive approach to personal projects. Among these, my most notable repository is the "issaw-package". Although it has yet to receive any stars, this Python library implements the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method, and I believe it holds potential usefulness for the Python community.

🌟 So far, I have accumulated 32 followers on GitHub, indicating some level of recognition and interest in my work. However, my profile is still in the early stages of growth, and I am excited about the potential to make a meaningful impact in the GitHub community.
